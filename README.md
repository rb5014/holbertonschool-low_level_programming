# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which  occurred
throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [ C - Hello, World](./hello_world)
* [ C - Variables, if, else, while](./variables_if_else_while)
* [ C - Functions, nested loops](./functions_nested_loops)
* [ C - More functions, more nested loops](./more_functions_nested_loops)
* [ C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./pointers_arrays_strings)
* [ C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./pointers_arrays_strings)
* [ C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](./pointers_arrays_strings)
* [ C - Recursion](./recursion)
* [ C - Static libraries](./static_libraries)
* [ C - argc, argv](./argc_argv)
* [ C - malloc, free](./malloc_free)
* [ C - More malloc, free](./more_malloc_free)
* [ C - Preprocessor](./preprocessor)
* [ C - Structures, typedef](./structures_typedef)
* [ C - Function pointers](./function_pointers)
* [ C - Variadic functions](./variadic_functions)
* [ C - Singly linked lists](./singly_linked_lists)
* [ C - More singly linked lists](./more_singly_linked_lists)
* [ C - Bit manipulation](./bit_manipulation)
* [ C - File I/O](./file_io)
* [ C - Doubly linked lists](./doubly_linked_lists)
* [ C - Dynamic libraries](./dynamic_libraries)
* [ C - Hash tables](./hash_tables)
* [ C - Sorting algorithms & Big O](./sorting_algorithms)
* [ C - Makefiles](./makefiles)
* [ C - Search Algorithms](./search_algorithms)
