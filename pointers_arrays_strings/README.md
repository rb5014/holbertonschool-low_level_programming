# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I learned about what and how to use pointers and arrays and
the differences between the two as well as how to use and manipulate strings in C.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. Provided by Holberton School.

## Helper File :raised_hands:

* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [holberton.h](holberton.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
